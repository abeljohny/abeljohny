Each string in this array represents a complete haiku, with its three lines separated by a line break (<br>) (e.g., \"First line<br>Second line<br>Third line\").\n\n**Rating Instructions:**\n\nFor each haiku:\n1.  **Determine an `overall_score`:**\n* This should be an integer from 1 (Poor) to 5 (Excellent).\n* In determining this score, please consider the haiku's adherence to the 5-7-5 syllable structure and its general poetic merit (such as clarity of imagery, emotional resonance, conciseness, effective word choice, and originality).\n2.  **Provide `reasoning`:**\n* A concise (1-2 sentences) explanation for your `overall_score`. This reasoning should briefly touch upon why the haiku received that score, considering its structure and poetic qualities.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nFor *each* haiku string you evaluate from the input list, provide a corresponding JSON object. Return a single JSON array containing all these evaluation objects. Each object MUST follow this exact structure:\n\n{\n    \"haiku_index\": integer, // The 0-based index of the haiku string from the input array\n    \"overall_score\": integer, // Score from 1 to 5\n    \"reasoning\": \"string\"   // Brief justification for the score\n}\n\nOnly output this structure and nothing else."
