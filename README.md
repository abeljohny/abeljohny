The daily haiku you see above is the product of a GitHub Actions workflow where:

1.  🐝 Three different Large Language Models (LLMs) each independently create a haiku.
2.  ⚖️ These LLMs then review and rate all three generated haikus on a scale of 1 (Poor) to 5 (Excellent) based on the haiku's adherence to the 5-7-5 syllable structure and its general poetic merit (clarity of imagery, emotional resonance, conciseness, effective word choice, and originality).
3.  🏆 The haiku with the highest mean score is chosen as the winner and automatically displayed above!

## 🧪 Welcome to the Lab!

This repository is a sandbox for exploring what happens when LLMs get creative together. 

My  goal is to learn, to play, and to showcase the wild and wonderful things LLMs can do. Unexpected results, odd turns of phrase, and delightful glitches are all part of the fun.

### 💬 Feedback is welcome!
